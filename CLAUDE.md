# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a Claude Code **plugin marketplace** containing plugins for Datadog .NET tracer development workflows. It currently hosts two plugins:
- `dd-trace-dotnet` - Core tracer development commands
- `dd-trace-dotnet-azure-functions` - Azure Functions-specific commands

## Repository Structure

**Critical architecture pattern**: This is a multi-plugin marketplace, NOT a single plugin repository.

```
claude-code-plugins/                        # Repository root
â”œâ”€â”€ marketplace.json                        # Defines available plugins (owner + plugins array)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                               # Marketplace overview for humans
â””â”€â”€ plugins/                                # Individual plugin directories
    â”œâ”€â”€ dd-trace-dotnet/                   # Each plugin is self-contained
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .claude-plugin/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugin.json                # Plugin metadata (name, version, author)
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ marketplace.json           # Plugin marketplace info
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commands/                      # Markdown files = slash commands
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AGENTS.md                      # AI context for this plugin
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                      # Plugin docs for humans
    â””â”€â”€ dd-trace-dotnet-azure-functions/   # Second plugin, same structure
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Key Concepts

### Marketplace vs Plugin Files

- **Root `marketplace.json`**: Registry of all plugins in this marketplace. Has `owner` object and `plugins` array with `name`, `source`, and `description` for each plugin.
- **Plugin `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`**: Individual plugin metadata. Has `name`, `version`, `author`, and `description`.
- **Plugin `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**: Extended metadata for marketplace listing (keywords, categories, commands list, dependencies).

### Command Files

Each `.md` file in a plugin's `commands/` directory becomes a slash command:
- Filename becomes command name: `commands/build-tracer.md` â†’ `/build-tracer`
- YAML frontmatter with `description` field is required
- Content provides guided instructions for executing the command

### AGENTS.md Files

Plugin-specific `AGENTS.md` files provide AI context:
- Repository structure and key locations
- Architecture patterns and conventions
- Development workflows
- Quick reference commands

**Important**: Each plugin has its own `AGENTS.md`. There is no root-level `AGENTS.md` for the marketplace itself.

## Adding a New Plugin

1. **Create plugin directory**: `plugins/your-plugin-name/`
2. **Required files**:
   - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Metadata
   - `commands/some-command.md` - At least one command
   - `README.md` - Documentation
   - `LICENSE` - License file
3. **Register in marketplace**: Add entry to root `marketplace.json` plugins array:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-plugin-name",
     "source": "./plugins/your-plugin-name",
     "description": "Brief description"
   }
   ```
4. **Test locally**: Copy plugin to test location and install via Claude Code

## Modifying Existing Plugins

### Adding a Command

1. Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/commands/new-command.md`
2. Include YAML frontmatter with description
3. Write step-by-step guidance
4. Test command loads: `/new-command`

### Moving Commands Between Plugins

When splitting functionality (like Azure Functions commands from core to specialized plugin):
1. Use `git mv` to preserve history: `git mv plugins/source/commands/file.md plugins/dest/commands/file.md`
2. Update both plugin READMEs to reflect command changes
3. Update root `marketplace.json` descriptions if needed
4. Consider plugin dependencies in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

## Testing Plugins

### Local Installation

```bash
# Add this repository as marketplace
/plugin marketplace add lucaspimentel/claude-code-plugins

# Install specific plugin
/plugin install dd-trace-dotnet@lucaspimentel
/plugin install dd-trace-dotnet-azure-functions@lucaspimentel
```

### Verification

- Run `/help` to verify commands appear
- Test each command with typical use cases
- Verify AGENTS.md provides useful context to AI

## Plugin Design Patterns

### Modularity

Plugins should be **composable**:
- `dd-trace-dotnet` = core functionality (build, test, integration creation)
- `dd-trace-dotnet-azure-functions` = specialized add-on (Azure Functions workflows)
- Users install what they need

### Command Scope

Commands should be **specific and actionable**:
- Good: `/build-tracer`, `/test-azure-functions`, `/debug-azure-functions`
- Avoid: `/help`, `/general-build` (too generic)

### Context via AGENTS.md

Each plugin's `AGENTS.md` should provide:
- Key file locations specific to that plugin's domain
- Architecture notes (e.g., "In-process vs isolated worker models")
- Common workflows for that domain
- **Not**: Generic development practices or obvious directory listings

## Commit Conventions

Follow conventional commits for clarity:
```
type(scope): brief description

Examples:
- feat(dd-trace-dotnet): add /check-logs command
- fix(azure-functions): correct NuGet build path
- docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md with testing guide
- refactor: split Azure Functions into separate plugin
```

Always include co-authorship footer for AI-generated commits:

## Documentation Files

- **README.md** (root): Marketplace overview, plugin listing, installation
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Plugin structure requirements, command guidelines, PR process
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history following Keep a Changelog format
- **Plugin README.md**: Plugin-specific docs with command reference and workflows
- **Plugin AGENTS.md**: AI context for working with that plugin's domain

## Notes for Future Development

### Plugin Ideas

When adding plugins for other repositories/workflows:
- Create in `plugins/` with same structure
- Register in root `marketplace.json`
- Follow naming convention: `{org}-{repo}-{specialization}` (optional specialization)
- Consider whether to split into core + specialized plugins

### Command Organization

Keep commands focused:
- 5-10 commands per plugin is reasonable
- Split into specialized plugins when a domain (like Azure Functions) has 5+ commands
- Use `dependencies.recommended` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to link related plugins
